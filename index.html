            I was born in Richmond, Virginia, and grew up there and in Ft Lauderdale, Florida. As a kid, I loved swimming, baseball, and singing. I started university in Arlington, Virginia but left to study abroad in Israel and then spent 2 years backpacking around central america and then moved to Spain and then France where I lived for 5 years. I worked in bars, nannied, taught english, and eventually taught GMAT. I loved teaching and meeting so many different types of people.

                        France, officially the French Republic, is a country in Western Europe. Its capital city is Paris. It is a member of the European Union. It is known for its culture, its many monuments and structures, and places such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Giverny, Mont Saint Michel, Versailles, and Notre Dame de Paris. France is divided into 13 régions that are further subdivided départements. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.

                        The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments.
